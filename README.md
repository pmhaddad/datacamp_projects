# Introduction

This repository contains the projects I am developing for classes I'm taking at
the DataCamp website.<br/>
Projects are divided by language: `Python` or `R`.

## Python projects

###1. Exploring 67 years of LEGO

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been 
sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks 
are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you 
will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your 
way around `pandas` dataframes and it's recommended that you take a look at the 
courses **pandas Foundations** and **Manipulating DataFrames with pandas**.

###2. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: 
He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever 
and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.<br/>
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. 
This project assumes that you are familiar with python and `pandas` DataFrames. 
You can learn the required skills in these courses: **Intermediate Python for 
Data Science** and **pandas Foundations**.

## R projects

###1.Phyllotaxis: Draw Flowers Using Mathematics

R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything 
in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things 
too. R can make art.<br/>
The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is 
called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe 
patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.<br/>
This R project assumes you have familiarity with the `ggplot2` package. If you 
don't know `ggplot2` we recommend you take either of the courses **Introduction 
to the Tidyverse** or **Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)**. If you 
want to see more examples of how you can use R to make art, you should check 
out the Fronkonstin blog created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.
