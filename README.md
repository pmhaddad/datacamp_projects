# Introduction

This repository contains the projects I am developing for classes I'm taking at
the DataCamp website.<br/>
Projects are divided by language: `Python` or `R`.

### Python projects

1. **Exploring 67 years of LEGO**<br/>
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been 
sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks 
are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you 
will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your 
way around `pandas` dataframes and it's recommended that you take a look at the 
courses **pandas Foundations** and **Manipulating DataFrames with pandas**.

Nothing to place here so far ;)
