# Introduction

This repository contains the projects I am developing for classes I'm taking at
the DataCamp website.<br/>
Projects are divided by language: `Python` or `R`.

### Python projects

**1. Exploring 67 years of LEGO**<br/>
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been 
sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks 
are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you 
will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your 
way around `pandas` dataframes and it's recommended that you take a look at the 
courses **pandas Foundations** and **Manipulating DataFrames with pandas**.

**2. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing**<br/>
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: 
He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever 
and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. 
This project assumes that you are familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. 
You can learn the required skills in these courses: **Intermediate Python for 
Data Science** and **pandas Foundations**.

### R projects

Nothing to place here so far ;)
